# Image Classifier Project

## Overview

This project is the final assignment for the AIPND (AI Programming with Python Nanodegree) program as part of the Udacity AWS AI/ML scholarships. The goal of this project is to develop an image classifier that can recognize different species of flowers using a deep learning model.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of images of 102 different flower categories, divided into training, validation, and test sets. Images are resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized using the ImageNet statistics.

## Installation

To run this project, you will need the following Python packages:

- `torch`
- `torchvision`
- `numpy`
- `PIL`

You can install these packages using pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy pillow
